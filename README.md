# fio-watch

Just a simple near-real-time monitor of FIO transactions. Intended for use on something like a Raspberry Pi or Android
tablet for watching transactions. It is *not* finished or ready for use. This is pre-alpha quality.transactions

Note also:

1. future planned ability is to use p2p not the http API, which will make this much more efficient.
1. This will overload a remote node, please only use locally!!!
